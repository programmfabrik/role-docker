# Ansible Role: Docker

This role installs and configures Docker and Docker-Compose.

Please note that you have to reboot your machine after installation for docker systemd service to start correctly.
This is because docker needs some kernel modules (error in logs below).
```
gitlab-runner.example.com dockerd[1234]: level=warning msg="Your kernel does not support cgroup rt runtime"
```

- hosts: all
